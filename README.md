# Open Follow-Up (OFUp)
---
## Introduction
---

This repository contains open-source tools for follow-up chemistry from fragment screening campaigns at XChem (https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html), but the tools can be applied anywhere else that is relevant.

There are example notebooks (see: https://github.com/xchem/OFUp/tree/master/example_notebooks) that are designed to guide the user through the process of selecting compounds for follow-up

These notebooks can be run from:
1. The containerised environment provided here (via. Docker container)
2. Manual installation (recommended: via. a conda environment)  


## Installation
---

This has only been  tested on Mac, but the beauty of docker containers is that they should run identically on any OS

### Container install

Requirements: 
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
